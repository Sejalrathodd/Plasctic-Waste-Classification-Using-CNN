# Plastic-Waste-Classification-Using-CNN

## Project Description
Plastic pollution is a growing concern globally, and effective waste segregation is critical to tackling this issue. This project employs a CNN model to classify plastic waste into distinct categories, facilitating automated waste management.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Waste Classification Data** by Sashaank Sekar. It contains a total of **25,077 labeled images**, divided into two categories: Organic and Recyclable. This dataset is designed to facilitate waste classification tasks using machine learning techniques.

### Key Details:
- **Total Images:** 25,077  
- **Training Data:** 22,564 images (85%)  
- **Test Data:** 2,513 images (15%)  
- **Classes:** Organic and Recyclable  
- **Purpose:** To aid in automating waste management and reducing the environmental impact of improper waste disposal.

## Approach:
1. Studied waste management strategies and white papers.
2. Analyzed the composition of household waste.
3. Segregated waste into two categories (Organic and Recyclable).
4. Leveraged IoT and machine learning to automate waste classification.
